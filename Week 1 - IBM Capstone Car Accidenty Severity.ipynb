If we can identify the most predictive attributes, we can predict what leads to more severe collisions and death. Local government officials could use this information to create targeted prevention programs - for example road warnings and speed bumps for drivers when weather/light/road conditions are not conducive to driver visibility, especially in specific junctions that may be more problematic (ie, tight turns, poorly lit road signs, etc). This information may be of interest to auto insurance companies who use data pertaining to areas with a higher frequency of parked car collisions when underwriting premiums. The goal of this project is prevention of car accidents and fatalities using a prediction model as the basis for targeted accident prevention programs."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### DATA"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The data for this project was collected from the provided Data-Collisions csv file in IBM's Applied Data Science Capstone Project. This dataset includes many features or attributes to build a predictive machine learning model such as location, date/time, severity, collision type, weather conditions, light conditions, road conditions, etc.\n\nData Highlights:\nThe data is for all types of collisions occurring in the city of Seattle from 2004 to 2020.\\\nThe data has been provided by SPD and include traffic records.\\\nThere are approximately 195,000 records.\\\n\nExploratory data analysis is the first step to understand the data and glean any hidden insights. Then we will select the attributes that have the greatest role in collision severity. Using supervised machine learning, we will create a model to predict the severity of a collision based on a number of features such as location, weather condition, road condition, light condition, car speeding, junction, number of people involved and/or number of vehicles involved used to train the model. The label for the data set is severity, describing the fatality of an accident. In looking at the type of fatalities in the data (label y), there are two kinds of collision outcomes, represented by 1 = Property Damage that tells us that damage was done to property or vehicle but no injury and 2 = Injury, indicating bodily injurty to the passengers, driver or pedestrian. \nData preparation will include balancing the labeled data to create an unbiased ML model, transformation, filling in any missing data, cleaning the dataset, and feature engineering will be performed to improve the predictability of the model. The chosen attributes will be assessed by looking for trends, certain patterns, skewed information, correlations, etc."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
